    <h5>Key Information</h5>

    <p>The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to be a part of this study. More detailed information is listed later on in this form.</p>

    <p><strong>Why am I being invited to take part in a research study?</strong>
      <br>We invite you to take part in a research study because we are interested in hearing in more depth about your experiences in the Getting Unstuck email course.</p>

    <p><strong>What should I know about a research study?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
        <li>Your participation is completely voluntary.</li>
        <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
        <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
        <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
        <li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Why is this research being done?</strong>
      <br>The purpose of the research is to learn more about how to design effective curricular materials to support teachers in learning and teaching debugging in the classroom.  We hope to help educators like you by building an online community of support and designing materials such as Scratch project challenges and email pep talks.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will the research last and what will I need to do?</strong>
      <br>We expect that Getting Unstuck: 21 Days of Scratch will run from July 5 – July 26, 2018. We are interested in some limited data at the beginning about who you are (through a quick 5 minute survey) as well as at the end (through a 10 minute survey). At the end, if you are interested, we would like to interview some participants individually for an hour. </p>

    <p><strong>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</strong>
      <br>We don’t believe there are any risks from participating in this research.

    <p><strong>Will being in this study help me in any way?</strong>
      <br>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, possible benefits include more effective iterations of the Getting Unstuck email course, moving forward, as well as better-designed curricular materials for you and other educators. We also hope that by practicing your Scratch skills daily, you build more of your own confidence. </p>



  Detailed Information
  The following is more detailed information about this study in addition to the information listed above.
  What is the purpose of this research?
  The purpose of this research is to learn more about how to design effective online materials to support teachers in learning and teaching debugging in Scratch, because supporting open-ended creative work in the classroom can be challenging when different students are getting stuck in a variety of ways. By participating in this interview, we hope that your experiences can help shape our design principles around designing future iterations of materials. And we hope to be better equipped to support teachers when they need it.
  How long will I take part in this research?
  We expect that Getting Unstuck: 21 Days of Scratch will run from July 5 – July 26, 2018. We are interested in some limited data at the beginning about who you are (through a quick 5-minute survey) as well as at the end (through a 10-minute survey). At the end, if you are interested, we would like to interview some participants individually for an hour.
  What can I expect if I take part in this research?
  If you want to take part in this research, you can fill out the survey at gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/signup.html to learn more, and at the end of July when we send out a follow-up survey, you can fill that out as well. If you would like to be interviewed at the end of Getting Unstuck, there will be a place on the follow-up survey to indicate your interest.
  What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?
  You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. You can also participate in Getting Unstuck without receiving the emails from us – all challenges will be listed at gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/challenges.html.
  If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected?  What happens to the information you collect?
  Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study and medical records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this organization.
  Who can I talk to?
  If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you, talk to Paulina Haduong at haduong@g.harvard.edu.
  This research has been reviewed and approved by the Harvard University Area Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). You may talk to them at (617) 496-2847 or cuhs@harvard.edu if:
